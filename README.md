# BlogImporter
Imports blogs from XBlog to LMM.

Create a package of the source XBlog data including Blogs, Authors, Categories, Tags, and the entire media library.  Rename this package to source.zip.  Copy it into the output folder of this application.

This application will read the package, translate it to the new structure, and then call the import api on the destination server (local by default) that will save all of the data.
